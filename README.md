# Poor Man's Catalog (creator)

I have been looking for the CD/Path catalog creators. But they are all too old to be used. Almost all of them were unmaintained for a long time and compiling them would be a big hassle. So, I decided to use this opportunity to do something with the QT Creator.

I have bunch of external harddrives, old archive DVDs and SDCards or FlashDrives and I often need to go through them to find what I am looking for.

Instead, now I use this tool now to create an index/catalog of those drives.

There are probably some parts that I totally messed up and the code might need some facelifting. In my defense, I created this for myself.

## Download

I have created a 64bit Deb package and a Win64 version here: https://github.com/sinanislekdemir/poorman/releases/tag/v1.0.3

## Notes

1. You need QT Creator (and obviously QT 5.x >) to compile and run this.
2. I am planning to create AppImage but I am too lazy to learn it. (Don't blame me, I'm a backend developer and a cli junkie)
3. I take no responsibility.
4. Feel free to create PRs. I always welcome them.

By default, it uses `~/poorman.sqlite` file but you can create multiple SQLite files.
